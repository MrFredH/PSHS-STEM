## Download and install GIT Desktop
When you want to work on a project you will have to download the project, the GIT Desktop is the best way to be able to update your changes.
Don't worry about breaking things, we can always look back at an older version.
Do try to only upload changes that at least compile without error.
Make small changes and commit/push often.
